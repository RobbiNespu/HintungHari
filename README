 Description: 
 This application started when I'm just playing with PHP + GD. Coincidentally with 
 the upcoming MOSC2011 event, I heard some people asking in the mailing list if it
 could be possible to have countdown banner for the event. Therefore, I modified 
 my useless code and make this HitungHari countdown banner application.

 Installation
 ------------
 1. Copy all files to your webserver directory.
 
 2. Rename 'mosc-countdown-img.php' to any name you like
 
 3. Change the images in 'countbg-images' to your event images.
    * please note that countdown number color is always yellow
      and I didn't make the position be flexible and available in
      config file yet. You can change this by modifying the 'mosc-countdown-img.php'
       
 4. Set the date of your event to countdown in hh-config.php
 
 5. you are set and ready to go
 
 
 Usage
 -----
 1. Open your web browser, and set the url to:
    http://yourdomain/yourhitunghari/mosc-countdown-img.php
    
    The default size is 290x200 px
    
 2. You can change the size to:
    - 300x250 px
      http://yourdomain/yourhitunghari/mosc-countdown-img.php?size=1
